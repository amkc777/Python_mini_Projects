# Dice Simulator

This Python script simulates rolling a six-sided dice and displays the result using ASCII art for each face.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amkc777/Python_mini_Projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Python_mini_Projects/dice_game
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python dice_simulator.py
    ```

4. Press Enter to roll the dice. Press 'q' to quit at any time.

5. After rolling the dice, the script will display the result using ASCII art depicting the face of the dice.

6. You can choose to roll the dice again by typing 'y' and pressing Enter, or exit the simulator by typing 'n' and pressing Enter.

## Description

This script utilizes the `random` module to simulate rolling a six-sided dice. Each face of the dice is represented with ASCII art, providing a visual representation of the dice roll.

The user can roll the dice multiple times until they decide to quit the simulator by pressing 'q' or choosing not to roll again.

This script demonstrates basic usage of random number generation, ASCII art, user input handling, and loop control in Python.
